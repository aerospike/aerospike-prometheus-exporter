# Aerospike Prometheus Exporter

This repo contains Aerospike's monitoring agent for Prometheus. The exporter is part of the [Aerospike Monitoring Stack](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/tools/monitorstack/index.html).

The Aerospike Prometheus Exporter is now **generally available** (GA).
If you're an enterprise customer feel free to reach out to support with any questions.
We appreciate feedback from community members on the [issues](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/issues).

## Aerospike Prometheus Exporter Configuration

- Aerospike Prometheus Exporter requires a configuration file to run. Check [default configuration file](ape.toml).
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /etc/aerospike-prometheus-exporter
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerospike/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/master/ape.toml -o /etc/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/ape.toml
    ```

- Edit `/etc/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/ape.toml` to add `db_host` (default `localhost`) and `db_port` (default `3000`) to point to an Aerospike server IP and port.
    ```toml
    [Aerospike]

    db_host="localhost"
    db_port=3000
    ```

- Configure timeout (in seconds) for info commands to Aerospike node (optional). Default value is `5` seconds.
    ```toml
    [Aerospike]
    # timeout for sending commands to the server node in seconds
    timeout=5
    ```

- Update Aerospike security and TLS configurations (optional),
    ```toml
    [Aerospike]

    # TLS certificates.
    # Supports below formats,
    # 2. Certificate file path                                      - "file:<file-path>"

    # Applicable to 'root_ca', 'cert_file' and 'key_file' configurations.

    # root certificate file
    root_ca=""

    # certificate file
    cert_file=""

    # key file
    key_file=""

    # Passphrase for encrypted key_file. Supports below formats,
    # 1. Passphrase directly                                                      - "<passphrase>"
    # 2. Passphrase via file                                                      - "file:<file-that-contains-passphrase>"
    # 3. Passphrase via environment variable                                      - "env:<environment-variable-that-holds-passphrase>"
    # 4. Passphrase via environment variable containing base64 encoded passphrase - "env-b64:<environment-variable-that-contains-base64-encoded-passphrase>"
    # 5. Passphrase in base64 encoded form                                        - "b64:<base64-encoded-passphrase>"

    # Aerospike cluster security credentials.
    # Supports below formats,
    # 1. Credential directly                                                      - "<credential>"
    # 2. Credential via file                                                      - "file:<file-that-contains-credential>"
    # 3. Credential via environment variable                                      - "env:<environment-variable-that-contains-credential>"

    auth_mode=""
    ```

- Update exporter's bind address and port (default: `0.0.0.0:9145`), and add labels.
    ```toml
    [Agent]

    bind=":9145"
    labels={zone="asia-south1-a", platform="google compute engine"}
    ```

- Use allowlist and blocklist to filter out required metrics (optional). The allowlist and blocklist supports standard wildcards (globbing patterns which include - `? (question mark)`, `* (asterisk)`, `[ ] (square brackets)`, `{ } (curly brackets)`, `[!]` and `\ (backslash)`) for bulk metrics filtering. For example,
    ```toml
    [Aerospike]

    # Metrics Allowlist - If specified, only these metrics will be scraped. An empty list will exclude all metrics.
    # Commenting out the below allowlist configs will disable metrics filtering (i.e. all metrics will be scraped).

    # Namespace metrics allowlist
    namespace_metrics_allowlist=[
    "client_read_[a-z]*",
    "stop_writes",
    "storage-engine.file.defrag_q",
    "client_write_success",
    "memory_*_bytes",
    "objects",
    "*_available_pct"
    ]

    # Set metrics allowlist
    set_metrics_allowlist=[
    "objects",
    "tombstones"
    ]

    # Node metrics allowlist
    node_metrics_allowlist=[
    "uptime",
    "cluster_size",
    "batch_index_*",
    "xdr_ship_*"
    ]

    # XDR metrics allowlist (only for Aerospike versions 5.0 and above)
    xdr_metrics_allowlist=[
    "success",
    "latency_ms",
    "throughput",
    "lap_us"
    ]

    # Metrics Blocklist - If specified, these metrics will be NOT be scraped.

    # Namespace metrics blocklist
    namespace_metrics_blocklist=[
    "memory_used_sindex_bytes",
    "client_read_success"
    ]

    # Set metrics blocklist
    # set_metrics_blocklist=[]

    # Node metrics blocklist
    node_metrics_blocklist=[
    "batch_index_*_buffers"
    ]

    # XDR metrics blocklist (only for Aerospike versions 5.0 and above)
    # xdr_metrics_blocklist=[]
    ```

- To enable basic HTTP authentication and/or enable HTTPS between the Prometheus server and the exporter, use the below configurations keys,
    ```toml
    [Agent]
    # Exporter HTTPS (TLS) configuration
    # HTTPS between Prometheus and Exporter

    # TLS certificates.
    # Supports below formats,
    # 1. Certificate file path                                      - "file:<file-path>"
    # 2. Environment variable containing base64 encoded certificate - "env-b64:<environment-variable-that-contains-base64-encoded-certificate>"
    # 3. Base64 encoded certificate                                 - "b64:<base64-encoded-certificate>"
    # Applicable to 'root_ca', 'cert_file' and 'key_file' configurations.

    # Server certificate
    cert_file = ""

    # Private key associated with server certificate
    key_file = ""

    # Root CA to validate client certificates (for mutual TLS)
    root_ca = ""

    # Passphrase for encrypted key_file. Supports below formats,
    # 1. Passphrase directly                                                      - "<passphrase>"
    # 2. Passphrase via file                                                      - "file:<file-that-contains-passphrase>"
    # 3. Passphrase via environment variable                                      - "env:<environment-variable-that-holds-passphrase>"
    # 4. Passphrase via environment variable containing base64 encoded passphrase - "env-b64:<environment-variable-that-contains-base64-encoded-passphrase>"
    # 5. Passphrase in base64 encoded form                                        - "b64:<base64-encoded-passphrase>"
    key_file_passphrase = ""

    # Basic HTTP authentication for '/metrics'.
    # Supports below formats,
    # 1. Credential directly                                                      - "<credential>"
    # 2. Credential via file                                                      - "file:<file-that-contains-credential>"
    # 3. Credential via environment variable                                      - "env:<environment-variable-that-contains-credential>"
    # 4. Credential via environment variable containing base64 encoded credential - "env-b64:<environment-variable-that-contains-base64-encoded-credential>"
    # 5. Credential in base64 encoded form                                        - "b64:<base64-encoded-credential>"
    basic_auth_username=""
    basic_auth_password=""
    ```

- Use users' allowlist and blocklist configuration to filter out the users for which the statistics are to be fetched. The user statistics are available in Aerospike 5.6+. To fetch user statistics, the authenticated user must have `user-admin` privilege.
    ```toml
    [Aerospike]

    # Users Statistics (user statistics are available in Aerospike 5.6+)
    # Users Allowlist and Blocklist to control for which users their statistics should be collected.
    # Note globbing patterns are not supported for this configuration.

    user_metrics_users_allowlist=[
    "admin",
    "superuser",
    "aerospikeUser1",
    "aerospikeUser2"
    ]

    user_metrics_users_blocklist=[
    "admin",
    "superuser"
    ]
    ```

- Exporter logs to console by default. To enable file logging, use `log_file` configuration to specify a file path. Use `log_level` configuration to specify a logging level (optional). Default logging level is `info`.
    ```toml
    [Agent]
    # Exporter logging configuration
    # Log file path (optional, logs to console by default)
    # Level can be info|warning,warn|error,err|debug|trace ('info' by default)
    log_file = ""
    log_level = ""
    ```

- Use `latency_buckets_count` to specify number of histogram buckets to be exported for latency metrics (optional). Bucket thresholds range from 2<sup>0</sup> to 2<sup>16</sup> (`17` buckets). All threshold buckets are exported by default (`latency_buckets_count=0`).

    Example, `latency_buckets_count=5` will export first five buckets i.e. `<=1ms`, `<=2ms`, `<=4ms`, `<=8ms` and `<=16ms`.
    ```toml
    [Aerospike]
    # Number of histogram buckets to export for latency metrics. Bucket thresholds range from 2^0 to 2^16 (17 buckets).
    # e.g. latency_buckets_count=5 will export first five buckets i.e. <=1ms, <=2ms, <=4ms, <=8ms and <=16ms.
    # Default: 0 (export all threshold buckets).
    latency_buckets_count=0
    ```
