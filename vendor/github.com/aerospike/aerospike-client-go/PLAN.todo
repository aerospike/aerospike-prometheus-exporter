move msgpack stuff to internal, mark the client v2

the issue of buffer allocation
the issue of header validation
the issue of non-accessible nodes (which are in the peer list, but only via local IPs)
the issue of remving nodes in big clusters: we don't remove all nodes, so the seed will not be tried again

add TLS CLI params to tests so that we can test them

 ☐ collectinfo in Go to include in the agent
 ☐ mesh/multicast seed nodes info commands
 ☐ migration stats for source -> dest
 ☐ migration time stats
 ☐ network and other stats XDR info commands
 ☐ realtime processing of logs to track events like migrations, database crashes, etc. (Tejas wants to do it)
