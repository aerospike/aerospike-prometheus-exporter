 CDT Notes
   ☐ Empty vs nil
   ☐ Get All ([0, -1])
   ☐ Ranges with count == 1
     ☐ Pop
     ☐ Remove
     ☐ GetRange works with 1
     ☐ GetRange, RemoveRange with only index is ugly, I prefer -1 as the end

 ☐ IncludeLDT flag == false returns the name of the LDT bins and the control bin with <nil> values, which violates the idea of Not having NULL bins
